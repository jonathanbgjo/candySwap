# CandySwap

Candy Crush mimic that includes basic login/registration functionality. This project currently can initialize 2D grid with random candies based off Level information in DB (dimensions, turns, score to beat). 
You are able to swap candies to increase score and grid will automatically shift if there is a match. 
You have a certain amount of turns to reach a specific score or you lose. Implemented a possible swap check that scans whole 2d grid for a potential swap (otherwise shuffle so game can continue).

Successfully added the save game functionality which will save the grid, turns, and score for any user on any level.  



Future implementations include more difficulties (grid size, obstacles, different objectives), special candies.
